This is a simple Discord bot that sends memes on command.


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
````

### 2. Install required packages

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add your Discord Bot Token

Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add your Discord bot token like this:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
```

**Important:** Never share your bot token publicly.

### 4. Run the bot

Run the bot using:

```bash
python3 bot.py
